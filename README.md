# Data Carpentry for Social Sciences & Humanities


Slides for days 1 and 2 of
[Data Carpentry for Social Sciences & Humanities](https://4turesearchdata-carpentries.github.io/2023-10-12-ldev-delft/).
Workshop held 12th and 13th October at TU Delft.

Slides are based on previous slides by [Claudiu Forgaci](https://github.com/cforgaci)
and [Aleksandra Ewa Wilczynska](https://github.com/alwil), which were in turn
based on my other slides... At this point it is basically a group effort!
